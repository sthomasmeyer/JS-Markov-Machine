 Markov chains are stochastic models that describe a sequence of possible events in which the probability of each event depends only on the state attained in the previous event. They have been used in many different domains, ranging from text generation to financial modeling. They can be implemented without the use of advanced statistical or mathematical concepts, and offer a great way to start learning about probabilistic modeling (+) data science techniques.
